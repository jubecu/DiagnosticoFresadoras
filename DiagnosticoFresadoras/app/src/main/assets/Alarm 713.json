					"Mensaje":"It is necessary to check the current of the vacuum pump with a clamp meter. If the current read is higher than the value showed in the nameplate, change the oil in the pump reservoir (changing the filters) and recheck the current again with the clamp. If it is still high, it would be necessary to change the entire pump."
